BROWSERjs(console):
Window is a predefined global object which has functions and attributes, that have to deal with window 
Location is another predefined object in browsers, that has all the information about the url we have loaded.
Document which is also another predefined global variable in browsers, has the html which is rendered
Browsers may have an object named “global”, but it will be the exact one as “window”
Moduling is not mandatory in client side JavaScript, i.e. in browsers

NODEjs:
Node doesn’t have a predefined “window” object cause it doesn’t have a window to draw anything.
Location object is related to a particular url; that means it is for page specific.
Node doesn’t have “document” object also, cause it never have to render anything in a page.
Require object is predefined in Node which is used to include modules in the app.
In Node everything is a module.
